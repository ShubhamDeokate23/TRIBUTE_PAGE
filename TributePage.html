                    <b>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi </b> (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948)<br>
                    was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist 
                    who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for 
                    India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights
                     and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'),
                      first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.<a

                        Gandhi's first major achievement came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar.
                     The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against largely Anglo-Indian plantation 
                     owners who were backed by the local administration. The peasants were forced to grow indigo (Indigofera sp.),
                     a cash crop for Indigo dye whose demand had been declining over two decades and were forced to sell
                     their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad. 
                     Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities.

                        Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi ( 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948)<br>
                        was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance<br>
                         to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule.

                        The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914,<br>
                        is now used throughout the world.

                    <li>
                        Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty,<br>
                         expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule
                    </li>
                    <li> Gandhi led local peoples in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) <strong> “Dandi Salt March in 1930”</strong><br>
                         and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India.

                    <li>
                        Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as<br>
                        the International Day of Nonviolence.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim nationalism which<br>
                         demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within British India. 
                    </li>
                    <li> Gandhi is considered to be the Father of the Nation in post-colonial India. During India's nationalist movement and in several decades<br>
                         immediately after, he was also commonly called Bapu.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Gandhi also campaigned hard going from one rural corner of the Indian subcontinent to another. He used terminology and phrases<br>
                         such as Rama-rajya from Ramayana, Prahlada as a paradigmatic icon, and such cultural symbols as another facet of swaraj and satyagraha
